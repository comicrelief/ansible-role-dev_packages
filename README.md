# Ansible role: Developer Packages

An Ansible role that installs Composer, NodeJs and manages their packages.

## Requirements

* Any php cli >= 5.5

## Role Variables

Available Variables are listed below, along with default values (see `default/main.yml`) and internal role values (see `vars/main.yml`):

### Defaults

```
packages_owner: user
packages_group: group
```

The owner and the group that Composer and NodeJs will be part of.

```
packages_composer: true
packages_composer_version: ''
packages_composer_home_path: ~/.composer
```

**packages_composer**: If this variable is true, the role will first check if Composer is installed and then it will install the packages defined.

**packages_composer_version**: The Composer version to be installed on the host.

**packages_composer_home_path**: The `COMPOSER_HOME` variable.

```
packages_composer_packages: {}
```

The Composer package(s) to be installed. The default variable is empty therefore the role won't install any package. If you want to define some packages, the dictionary accepts two values:

* name - name of the package to install (eg `phing/phing`)
* release - version of the package to install (eg `@latest`)

```
packages_nodejs: true
packages_nodejs_version: v4.4.7
packages_nodejs_arc: x64
```

**packages_nodejs**: If this variable is true, the role will first check if NodeJs is installed and then it will install the packages defined.

**packages_nodejs_version**: The NodeJs version to be installed on the host.

**packages_nodejs_arc**: The host processor Architecture used to assemble NodeJs download url.

```
packages_nodejs_npm_packages: {}
packages_nodejs_npm_config_dir: /usr/local/lib/npm
```

**packages_nodejs_npm_packages**: The Npm package(s) to be installed. The default variable is empty therefore the role won't install any package. If you want to define some packages, the dictionary accepts two values:

* name - name of the package to install (eg `grunt-cli`)
* release - version of the package to install (eg `latest`)

**packages_nodejs_npm_config_dir**: The directory where npm will install the given packages to.

### Internal Role Variables

These variables won't be changed very often.

```

**packages_composer_path**: The directory where Composer will be installed to.

**packages_composer_bin**: The name of the Composer binary.
